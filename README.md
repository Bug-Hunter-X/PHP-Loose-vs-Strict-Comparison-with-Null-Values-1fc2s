# PHP Loose vs Strict Comparison with Null Values

This repository demonstrates a common error in PHP related to loose and strict comparison operators when working with `null` values.  Incorrect assumptions about how `null` behaves with comparison operators can lead to unexpected program behavior and subtle bugs.

The `bug.php` file contains code that illustrates the problem. The `bugSolution.php` file offers a corrected version.

The core issue is that `null` is not strictly equal (`===`) to `false`, even though many programmers might intuitively treat it as such in a boolean context. Using loose comparison (`==`) can mask this difference, leading to unexpected behavior.
